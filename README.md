_Create an object detection model in Azure Custom Vision and run the model locally in a desktop app in minutes._ ‚ú®

This is a sample project to use an object detection model, created using  [Azure Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai), locally in a desktop application. The model is extracted from the "*Custom Vision Export to Docker - Linux*" feature.

To build an Object Detection project, you can follow this tutorial: [Quickstart: Build an object detector with the Custom Vision website
](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector)

***Disclaimer**: This demo uses a virtual environment with Python 3.7 as is the required version to run some of the project dependencies.*


## Prerequisites

1. **üêç Anaconda**

    Download and install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
1. **ü™Ñ Create a local virtual environment**

    Open Anaconda PowerShell Prompt.
    Run the following commands to create a virtual environment named [demo]

    ```bash
    conda create -n demo python=3.7
    conda activate demo
    ```
    
    Once the virtual env is activated the PowerShell window must show the (demo) env.

1. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Install project dependencies**: 

    Run the following commands to install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    # install latest version of OpenCV
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

    ```bash
    # Install tensorflow and general dependencies
    pip install --no-cache-dir numpy~=1.17.5 tensorflow~=2.0.2 flask~=2.1.2 pillow~=7.2.0 protobuf~=3.20.0
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Install image processing library
    pip install --no-cache-dir mscviplib
    ```

    The environment is ready to be used.

1. **‚úÖ Check environment state**: 

    The file `00CheckEnv.py` will test if all the requirements are sucessfully installed.

    Run the check environment file with the command.

    ```bash    
    python .\00CheckEnv.py
    ```

    The output should be similar to this one:

    ```bash    
    TensorFlow: 2.0.4
    OpenCV: 4.8.0
    ```

## Download the Custom Vision model

1. Once you have you model trained, export and download a Docker Linux version of the model.

2. Extract the model and, from the app folder, copy the following files to the `src` folder of this repository.
    - labels.txt
    - model.pb
    - predict.py

## Select the right Camera

1. The file `.\src\05CameraTest.py` will allow us to identify the right camera to use. Edit the file and change  the number in the line [cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)] until the right camera is in use.

    ```python
    import cv2
    import time

    # access to the camera, change the index to use the right camera
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    ```

1. Navigate to the `src` folder and run the file `05CameraTest.py` with the command.

    ```bash    
    python .\05CameraTest.py
    ```

## Run Locally

1. The file `.\src\10CameraApp.py` will use the camera and the exported model to detect object and display the objects in a window. Update the file to use the right.

1. Navigate to the `src` folder and run the app with the command.

    ```bash    
    python .\10CameraApp.py
    ```

1. Once the app is running, you can press the following keys to enable / disable some features.
    - Press D to enable or disable the detection
    - Press L to show or hide the labels
    - Press F to show or hide the FPS
    - Press Q to exit


1. This is an example of the app running.
